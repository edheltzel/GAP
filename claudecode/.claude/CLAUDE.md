## MEMORY

You have persistent memory via Recall. **Read the full guide:** /Users/ed/.claude/Recall_GUIDE.md

Core rules:
1. Before asking user to repeat anything → search first with `memory_search`
2. Before spawning agents (Task tool) → call `context_for_agent`
3. When decisions are made → record with `memory_add`
4. End of session when user says `/dump` → run `mem dump "Descriptive Title"`

Tool syntax:
- `memory_search({ query: "search terms" })`
- `memory_add({ type: "decision", content: "what", detail: "why" })`
- `context_for_agent({ task_description: "what the agent will do" })`
